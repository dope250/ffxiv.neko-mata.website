Dopine loves to explore new landscapes, master small challenges and take photos. She starts to get very picky quickly if it doesn't go like she has planned. However, this evaporates just as quickly as it came and you don't have to worry about it.

She did grown up around ~ 2012 in **World of Warcraft** as **blood elve** and did already swung the bow as **Beastmaster**, with her faithful dragon called **Dopsi** and her ghost beast **Fidget**.

Always trying to wear chic, but also battle-proven clothes :disguised_face:

After some time and loneliness however she left **Kalimdor** and the **Eastern Kingdoms**. The reasons are numerous and diverse.

Now she has been roaming **since 2020** Eorzea as a bard and is happier than ever. However, if you consider she was already was roaming in 2014 (=beta). Therefore, the second name probably also came from there somehow... :shushing_face:
