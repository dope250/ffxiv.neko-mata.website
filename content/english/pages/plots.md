#### 🐾 Our Home

For our common FC activities, we have a selection of land that is really perfect for every activity. In our main building, the **Katzenkoerbchen**, we usually all gather around. The rooms there are inhabited and furnished with a lof of love by many Nekos.

👉 All our Plots are on **Alpha** in datacentre **Light**.

If you want to visit us to just chat a bit or marvel at the great interior, have a look in the following places:

#### The "Katzenkörbchen"

Our popular meeting point for all Nekos and those who would like to be. Here will be feasted, chattered and of course played together (with claws!).

* 25th district in Shirogane - Plot 60

#### The "Neko:Events"

Neko:Events is used for a wide variety of events and is constantly redesigned.

* 25th district in Shirogane - Plot 59

😖 You just can't go into the game, but still want to know what it looks like with us? Then just have a look through our selection of pictures.
