> Nekomata are a kind of cat yōkai described in Japanese folklore, classical kaidan, essays, etc. There are two very different types: those that live in the mountains and domestic cats that have grown old and transformed into yōkai. - from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekomata)

#### 🐾

🧓 Our average age is around 30, and we take the adventures of life with a wink. Sometimes dirty jokes fly through the chat like goblin sparks - but don't worry everyone can expect at least a harmless flat joke or a cheeky saying that makes us all smile.

⏳ Patience is our secret strength: we know that big acts and epic adventures takes time. We are not afraid to land face-first on the floor to master mechanics - while the real heroes with passion and training can rock the battlefields.

🤝 Always with a pinch of fun and a good mood!
